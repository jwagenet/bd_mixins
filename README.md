# pycad-workspace

Personal workspace for python codeCAD projects, demos, and examples.

## Setup

- `uv venv && .venv\Scripts\activate` on windows to set up venv
- `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml` should be sufficient to get up and running
- `ocp_vscode` requires vscode and the "OCP CAD Viewer" extension
- Run ocp_vscode in the "OCP CAD Viewer" > "VIEWER MANAGER"  panel, if an instance isn't already running
  - "OCP CAD Viewer" > "LIBRARY MANAGER" should indicate `uv` as installer and correct environment
